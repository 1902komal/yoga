    <p>YOGA</p>
    <p> The word meaning of “Yoga” is an intimate union of human soul with God. Yoga is an art and takes into purview the mind, 
    the body and the soul of the man in its aim of reaching Divinity. The body must be purified and strengthened through Ashtanga Yogas-Yama, 
    Niyama, Asanas and Pranayama. The mind must be cleansed from all gross through Prathyaharam, Dharana, Dhyanam and Samadhi. 
    Thus the soul should turn inwards if a man should become a yogic adept. Knowledge purifies the mind and surrender takes the soul towards God.
